In my Quiz Flutter app, I applied essential skills such as configuring columns and creating custom-styled buttons for a responsive layout.
I efficiently managed data by accessing list elements, utilizing the spread operator.
I enhanced visual appeal with third-party packages, including Google Fonts, and ensured seamless data handling through functions, maps, and "for" loops. 
Additionally, I optimized layout management and user experience by filtering lists and making content scrollable.
